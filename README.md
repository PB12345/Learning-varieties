### How to make dimension diagrams
The function that creates the dimension diagrams is
```@docs
DimensionDiagrams(
    data::Array{T,2},
    projective::Bool;
    methods  = [:CorrSum, :BoxCounting, :PHCurve, :NPCA, :MLE, :ANOVA],
    eps_ticks = 25,
    fontsize = 16,
    lw = 4,
    log_log = false
    ) where {T <: Number}
```
Here:
* ``data`` is a matrix whose columns are the data points in Ω.
* ``projective = false``: makes diagrams in euclidean space.
* ``projective = true``: makes diagrams in projective space.
There are some optional arguments.
* ``methods``: lists the dimension estimators to be plotted.
* ``eps_ticks = k``: puts k evenly spaced ϵ into [0,1]. At those ϵs the dimensions are computed.
* ``fontsize``: sets the font size of the axes.
* ``lw``: sets the line width.
* ``log_log = true``: makes a plot in the log-log scale.

#### Example
```julia
DimensionDiagrams(data, true)
```
